- First scale, then rotate, then translate!

- Pitch is through y-plane

- Yaw is through x-plane

- Roll is around z-axis

- Local Space (Object Space) // Each objects origin 
-> Model Matrix
- World Space				 // All objects with respect to world origin
-> View Matrix
- View Space (Eye Space)     // Then what those objects look like through camera
-> Projection Matrix
- Clip Space			     // Then force through range -1,1 enc 3D
-> Viewport Transform
- Screen Space				 // Final window appearance through screen

- Have present a shader than contains fragment and vertex handling information

- Have a vertex array buffer object to point to individual vertex buffer objects and element buffer objects 

- Have vertex buffer objects holding the vertex information

- Have indicies inside the element buffer objects telling interpretation to the gpu

- attach to a shader program the vertex and fragment shaders, then delete them after attached
